<%= form_for :blog, url: '/blog' , method: :post do |form| %>
  <!--
    Not sure why I can't just use :blog anymore; It started complaining that
    there was no /blog/new post route, but I thought that complaint was fixed...
    Works fine if I render the form directly rather than through a partial.

  <%= render 'form', form: form %>
